# Effect of Evolutionary Dynamics on Networks with Tree structure
Abstract:


Evolutionary dynamics, Moran process, and fixation probability are important concepts
in the field of complex systems, particularly in the context of genetic evolution. Understand-
ing each of these concepts plays a crucial role in comprehending the evolutionary process, and
they can be effectively studied through modeling and the use of evolutionary graph theory.


Evolutionary dynamics examines population changes over time, and the Moran process is one
of the models within evolutionary dynamics. The Moran process illustrates how population
changes occur through differences in the fitness of species over time, under the influence of
evolutionary mechanisms such as natural selection and genetic drift. This process is particu-
larly useful for studying the evolution of small populations over discrete time steps. Fixation
probability refers to the probability of a genetic trait becoming established and spreading
throughout a population. 

Evolutionary dynamics investigates how this fixation probability
is influenced by evolutionary processes such as natural selection and genetic drift. Through
the application of evolutionary dynamics methods, one can predict the fixation probability
and the time required for the fixation of genetic traits. Therefore, evolutionary dynamics is a
broad concept that explores population changes and evolution over discrete time steps. The
Moran process, time, and fixation probability examine the transfer and establishment of ge-
netic traits within populations.
